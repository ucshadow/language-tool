# An app I built to help me learn a new language.

## should workwith any language supported by bing translator

It takes a list of words in the original language, downloads the translation to the target language, downloads audio files for the target language (of the spoken work or phrase)
and downloads 3 images representing that word (or phrase). Images are downloaded but not guaranteed to represent the meaning, althought most of the times they do.
